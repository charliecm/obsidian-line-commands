# Obsidian Line Tools

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that adds the following commands:

- **Select lines:** Selects the lines under the selection or cursor.
- **Copy lines:** Copies the lines under the selection or cusor.
- **Cut lines:** Cuts the lines under the selection or cursor.
- **Paste before line:** Pastes the clipboard text in the line before the selection or cursor.
- **Paste after line:** Pastes the clipboard text in the line after the selection or cursor.

I wrote this plugin because I wanted a quick way to cut a line on mobile. However, the default cut command doesn't behave the way it does on desktop (cutting the entire line under the cursor when there's no selection). Therefore, the ‚Äúcut lines‚Äù command makes it easier for me to move lines quickly without needing to painstakingly select lines accurately with my fingers.

You can add these commands to your **toolbar on mobile** to easily access them.
